- [ ] A production README, replacing this README
- [ ] Notes
  - [ ] Smooth, bug-free navigation
  - [ ] Adequate seed data to demonstrate the site's features
  - [ ] Adequate CSS styling
- [ ] Notebooks for organizing notes

React Components

In addition to the view wireframes, you should diagram a tree indicating your application's overall component structure.
 See the sample project proposal for an example of this.

Flux Cycles

Flux loops are organized by data type. Under each data type, there may be sub- categories,
and each action is listed with the sequence of events that result from its invocation, ending with the API or store.
Finally, store listeners are listed at the end.

You should be able to use this document trace an action starting with where it was invoked,
through the API/store involved, and finally to the components that update as a result.
This is important because once you start implementing your flux loops, that's precisely what you'll need to do.

DB Schema

Link to a document outlining the database schema for your app. Build up the schema by walking through your app's wireframes.
Think carefully about what data will be needed for each view and the best way to store that data.
Make note of any database-level validations and foreign key relationships.

API Endpoints

Link to a page that lists your Rails API endpoints. Break these up between HTML and JSON endpoints.

Implementation Timeline

This will be the road map for your application. Rather than building the entire project all at once,
you're going to implement one feature at a time. Refer back to your MVP and group the features into logical phases.
You should have a working app at the end of each phase (even if not all of your features are in yet).
For each phase, write a brief game plan and list out any third-party APIs, front-end and back-end components you will need to implement.




FOR MYSELF:
Hi Richard,

You've ben approved to create OKCupid as your capstone project!

Here is the MVP feature set:
Browse and search other users by location and ‘looking for’
Messaging
Personality questions
Match percentages based on question answers
And here's some optional bonus feature:
Bonus: block or hide other users
Bonus: mark importance of questions and weight accordingly in % match
Let me know if you want to talk about any of those things. I'll be your Project Manager for the remainder of the course. This means:
I'll review and approve your proposal.
I'll need to approve any subsequent changes, timeline adjustments, or major project decisions.
I'll check in on your progress every day.
I'll review and report on your MVP progress 3 times a week.
Looking forward to working with you. Let's see what we can put together!
