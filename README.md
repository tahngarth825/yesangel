Implementation Timeline

This will be the road map for your application. Rather than building the entire project all at once,
you're going to implement one feature at a time. Refer back to your MVP and group the features into logical phases.
You should have a working app at the end of each phase (even if not all of your features are in yet).
For each phase, write a brief game plan and list out any third-party APIs, front-end and back-end components you will need to implement.
